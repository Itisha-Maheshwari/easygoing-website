    <i><h1><u><mark>"POLLUTION"</mark></u></h1></i>

<title>TAG practice</title>






<br><mark>Water pollution</mark> occurs when <u>harmful</u> <u>substances</u>—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, <u>degrading water quality</u> and rendering it <mark>toxic</mark> to humans or the environment.

    This <mark>widespread</mark> problem of water pollution is jeopardizing our health. Unsafe water <mark>kills</mark> more people each year than war and all other forms of violence combined. Meanwhile, <u>our drinkable water sources are finite</u>. Less than <mark>1 percent</mark> of the earth's freshwater is actually accessible to us. Without action, the <u>challenges</u> will only increase by <u>2050</u>, when global demand for freshwater is expected to be one-third greater than it is now. 

    <br>
    <br>

    Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a <mark>“universal solvent”</mark>, water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. It's the reason we have <mark>Kool-Aid and brilliant blue waterfalls</mark>. It's also why water is so easily polluted. Toxic substances from farms, towns, and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution.
<br>
<br>

    Here are some of the <u>major sources of water pollution worldwide</u>:
    <br>
    <br>

    <i><h2><u>Agricultural:-</u></h2></i>

  Not only is the <u>agricultural sector</u> the <mark>biggest consumer of global freshwater resources</mark>, with farming and livestock production using about <u>70 percent</u> of the earth’s surface water supplies, but it’s also a serious <mark>water polluter</mark>. Around the world, agriculture is the <mark>leading cause</mark> of water degradation. In the <mark>United States</mark>, agricultural pollution is the <u>top source</u> of contamination in rivers and streams, the <u>second-biggest source in wetlands</u>, and the <u>third main source in lakes</u>. It’s also a major contributor of contamination to estuaries and groundwater. Every time it rains, fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste from farms and livestock operations wash nutrients and pathogens—such bacteria and viruses—into our waterways. Nutrient pollution, caused by excess nitrogen and phosphorus in water or air, is the <mark>number-one threat</mark> to water quality worldwide and can cause algal blooms, a toxic soup of blue-green algae that can be <u>harmful to people and wildlife</u>.
<br>
<br>

<i><h2><u>Sewage and Wastewater:-</u></h2></i>

<u>Used water is wastewater</u>. It comes from our sinks, showers, and toilets (think sewage) and from commercial, industrial, and agricultural activities (think metals, solvents, and toxic sludge). The term also includes <mark>stormwater runoff</mark>, which occurs when rainfall carries road salts, oil, grease, chemicals, and debris from impermeable surfaces <u>into our waterways</u>.
<br>
<br>
More than <mark>80 percent</mark> of the world’s wastewater flows back into the environment <u>without being treated or reused</u>, according to the United Nations; <u>in some least-developed countries</u>, the figure tops <mark>95 percent</mark>. In the <u>United States</u>, wastewater treatment facilities process about <mark>34 billion gallons of wastewater per day</mark>. These facilities reduce the amount of pollutants such as pathogens, phosphorus, and nitrogen in sewage, as well as heavy metals and toxic chemicals in industrial waste, before discharging the treated waters back into waterways. That’s when all goes well. But <u>according to EPA</u> estimates, our nation’s aging and easily overwhelmed sewage treatment systems also release <mark>more than 850 billion gallons of untreated wastewater each year</mark>.
<br>
<br>

<i><h2><u>Oil Pollution:-</u></h2></i>

Big spills may dominate headlines, but consumers account for the vast majority of oil pollution <mark>in our seas</mark>, including oil and gasoline that drips from millions of cars and trucks <mark>every day</mark>. Moreover, nearly half of the estimated <mark>1 million tons of oil</mark> that makes its way into marine environments <mark>each year</mark> comes not from tanker spills but from land-based sources such as factories, farms, and cities. <mark>At sea</mark>, tanker spills account for about <mark>10 percent of the oil</mark> in waters around the world, while regular operations of the <u>shipping industry</u>—through both <mark>legal and illegal discharges</mark>—<u>contribute about one-third</u>. Oil is also naturally released from under the ocean through fractures known as <mark>seeps</mark>.
<br>
<br>

<i><h2><u>Radioactive Substances:-</u></h2></i>

<u>Radioactive waste</u> is any pollution that emits radiation beyond what is naturally released by the environment. It’s <mark>generated by</mark> <u>uranium mining, nuclear power plants</u>, and the production and testing of military weapons, as well as by universities and hospitals that use radioactive materials for research and medicine. Radioactive waste can <u>persist</u> in the environment <mark>for thousands of years</mark>, making <mark>disposal a major challenge</mark>. Consider the decommissioned Hanford nuclear weapons production site <mark>in Washington</mark>, where the <u>cleanup of 56 million gallons of radioactive waste</u> is expected to <u>cost more than $100 billion</u> and last through 2060. Accidentally released or improperly disposed of contaminants threaten groundwater, surface water, and marine resources.

<u><i><h2>What type of water is being impacted?</h2></i></u>

<ul type="square">

<li>Groundwater Pollution  </li>
<li> Surfacewater Pollution</li>
<li>Oceanwater Pollution </li>

</ul>

<i><u><h2>What are the effects of Water Pollution?</h2></u></i>

<ul type="disc">

    <li>On human health</li>
<li>On the environment</li>


</ul>

<u><strong>1. On human health-
</strong></u> To put it bluntly: Water pollution kills. In fact, it <mark>caused 1.8 million deaths in 2015</mark>, according to a study published in The Lancet. Contaminated water can also make you ill. Every year, unsafe water <mark>sickens about 1 billion people</mark>. And low-income communities are disproportionately <mark>at risk</mark> because their homes are often closest to the most polluting industries.
<br>
<br><mark>Waterborne pathogens</mark>, in the form of disease-causing bacteria and viruses from human and animal waste, are a major cause of illness from contaminated drinking water. Diseases spread by unsafe water include <mark>cholera, giardia</mark>, and <mark>typhoid</mark>. Even in wealthy nations, <u>accidental or illegal releases</u> from sewage treatment facilities, as well as runoff from farms and urban areas, contribute harmful pathogens to waterways. Thousands of people across the United States are sickened every year by <mark>Legionnaires’ disease</mark> (a severe form of pneumonia contracted from water sources like cooling towers and piped water), with cases cropping up from <u>California’s Disneyland</u> to <u>Manhattan’s Upper East Side</u>.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the plight of residents in Flint, <mark>Michigan</mark>—where cost-cutting measures and aging water infrastructure created a lead <mark>contamination crisis</mark>—offers a stark look at how dangerous chemical and other industrial pollutants in our water can be. The problem goes far beyond Flint and involves much more than lead, as a wide range of <u>chemical pollutants</u>—from heavy metals such as <mark>arsenic</mark> and <mark>mercury to pesticides</mark> and <mark>nitrate fertilizers</mark>—are getting into our water supplies. Once they’re ingested, these toxins can cause a <mark>host of health issues</mark>, from <mark>cancer</mark> to <mark>hormone disruption</mark> to <mark>altered brain function</mark>. Children and pregnant women are particularly <mark>at risk</mark>.
<br>
<br>Even swimming can pose a risk. Every year, <mark>3.5 million Americans</mark> contract health issues such as <mark>skin rashes, pinkeye, respiratory infections, and hepatitis</mark> from sewage-laden coastal waters, <u>according to EPA estimates</u>.
<br>
<br>

<u><strong>2. On the environment-</strong></u> In order to thrive, <mark>healthy ecosystems</mark> rely on a <u>complex web of animals, plants, bacteria</u>, and <u>fungi</u>—all of which interact, directly or indirectly, with each other. Harm to any of these organisms can create a <mark>chain effect</mark>, imperiling entire aquatic environments.
<br>
<br>
When water pollution causes an <mark>algal bloom</mark> in a lake or marine environment, the proliferation of newly introduced nutrients stimulates plant and algae growth, which in turn <u>reduces oxygen levels in the water</u>. This dearth of oxygen, known as <mark>eutrophication</mark>, suffocates plants and animals and can <mark>create “dead zones”</mark>, where waters are essentially devoid of life. In certain cases, these harmful algal blooms can also <mark>produce neurotoxins</mark> that <u>affect wildlife</u>, from whales to sea turtles.
<br>
<br>

<mark>Chemicals and heavy metals</mark> from industrial and municipal wastewater contaminate waterways as well. These contaminants are <mark>toxic to aquatic life</mark>—most often <u>reducing an organism’s life span</u> and ability to reproduce—and make their way up the food chain as predator eats prey. That’s how <mark>tuna and other big fish</mark> <u>accumulate</u> high quantities of <u>toxins</u>, such as <mark>mercury</mark>.
<br>


<u><h2>What can you do to prevent Water Pollution?</h2></u>


<ul type="square">
<li><u><h3>With your actions:</h3></u></li>
</ul>

<ul type="circle">
<li><mark>Learn about the unique qualities of water</mark> where you live. Where does your water come from? Is the wastewater from your home treated? Where does stormwater flow to? Is your area in a drought? Start building a picture of the situation so you can discover where your actions will have the most impact—and see if your neighbors would be interested in joining in! </li>
<br>
<br>

<li><mark>Reduce your plastic consumption</mark> and <mark>reuse or recycle plastic</mark> when you can. </li>
<br>
<br>


<li><mark>Proper dispose</mark> of chemical cleaners, oils, and nonbiodegradable items to keep them from going down the drain. </li>
<br>
<br>

<li><mark>Maintain your car</mark> so it doesn’t leak oil, antifreeze, or coolant. </li>
<br>
<br>

<li> If you have a yard, <mark>consider landscaping</mark> that reduces runoff and avoid applying pesticides and herbicides.</li><br>
<br>

<li><mark>Don’t flush your old medications!</mark> Dispose of them in the trash to prevent them from entering local waterways. </li>
<br>
<br>

<li><mark>Be mindful of anything you pour into storm sewers</mark>, since that waste often won’t be treated before being released into local waterways. If you notice a storm sewer blocked by litter, clean it up to keep that trash out of the water. (You’ll also help prevent troublesome street floods in a heavy storm.) </li>
</ul>

<ul type="square"> <li><u><h3>With your voice</h3></u></li></ul>

<ul type="circle"> 

<li>One of the most effective ways to stand up for our waters is to speak out in support of the <mark>Clean Water Act</mark>, which has helped <u>hold polluters accountable for five decades,</u>—despite attempts by <mark>destructive industries</mark> to gut its authority. But we also need regulations that keep pace with <mark>modern-day challenges</mark>, including <u>microplastics</u>, <u>PFAS</u>, <u>pharmaceuticals</u>, and other contaminants as wastewater treatment plants weren’t built to handle. </li><br>
